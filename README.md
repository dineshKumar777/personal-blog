[base-template repo](https://github.com/schardev/nextjs-contentlayer-blog)

## Getting Started with base template

1. Clone the starter template:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schardev/nextjs-contentlayer-blog
```

2. Add site information and relevant data to `lib/siteConfig.ts`.
3. Add your blog posts to `content/blog` directory with proper front-matter (see available fields [here](https://github.com/schardev/nextjs-contentlayer-blog/blob/main/schema/contentlayer/blog-post.ts))
4. Build your blog with:

```bash
pnpm build
```

5. Deploy to your hosting provider ðŸŽ‰

Starting a development server isn't different either, just run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Now open `http://localhost:3000` to view changes to your blog as it happens.
