## Confession Time

As most other devs, I spent too much time on developing blog from scratch or finding perfect template instead of actual blogging.

> But not anymore.

I am finally publishing the first blog post and continue posting further.

## Whats the Plan?

I will be posting about my personal experiences, learnings, and some tech stuff. I will also be sharing some of my projects and their development process.


## This site

I failed miserably on developing a blog from scratch. React router is confusing as hell. Hopefully in future will be able to develop a blog from scratch. For now settled with this good template I am happy with.

Will continue to improve the site and add more features.
